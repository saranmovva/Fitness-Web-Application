# Fitness-Web-Application
This is a fitness web application designed to keep track of a user√≠s weight loss/gain progress over time. The user registers and is stored into a database. The user is required to enter their name, email, and password, and once that is validated, the user is brought to the login page. After verification, the user is prompted to enter their age, gender, and height. Once everything has been met, the user is brought to the dashboard, which allows the user to enter a date and weight, which is then stored and displayed on a chart. From there, the user has access to a nav bar that includes a Basal Metabolic Rate calculator, a Body Mass Index calculator, a settings page for the user, a log out feature, and a search bar that allows you to search for recipes.
